- 20+ years of experience in crafting software solutions that solve complex business problems.

- I am a developer, not a programmer.

- I believe that technology exists to serve the business and not the other way around.

- I am experienced in all stages of the software development cycle including requirements gathering, analysis, design, development, documentation, implementation, testing, maintenance, user training, migration, and on-going support.

- I believe that preventing problems is as important as solving them.

- Communication is the key to successful software projects.
